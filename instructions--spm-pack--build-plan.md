# Application Planning Instructions

## Your Task

Your task is to create an initial plan for the implementation of a new feature for the command line tool called `spm` (Specky Package Manager).

We are implementing an MVP that already has one feature:
- `spm init`: initialising a Specky Project with a spec.json file

You need to implement the next feature:
- `spm pack`: packaging a Specky Component 

You should review the relevant documents (outlined later) and create a detailed step-by-step plan for implementing the 
new feature. Your plan will then be used by the developers to implement the application.

## Relevant Documents

### Component Specifications

In the components directory, you will find a series of components which will be used as the foundation of the 
application. Each subdirectory in the componets directory outline detailed requirements for each component. 

```
./components/
├── component-name/
│   ├── spec.json
│   ├── component.md
│   ├── datamodel.json
│   └── tests/
│       └── *.feature
```

Each component consists of:

1. **spec.json**: Contains metadata about the component
2. **component.md**: Describes the component in detail
3. **datamodel.json** (optional): Models entities that the component relies on
4. **tests/*.feature** (optional): Gherkin feature specifications for testing

Your focus should be: `./components/spm-pack`

## Expected Output

Please create a document called `implementation-plan--spm-pack.md` which includes:
- the steps required to implement the new feature in the existing project
- a step-by-step plan with checkbox notation so we can track our progress e.g. `[ ]`
